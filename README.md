## Silvercharter CLI

This repo hosts the in-store CLI for managing Shopify products via PriceCharting data.

### Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
```

The CLI will prompt for Imports / Products / Settings. Environment variables live in `data/.env`.

### Docs

See `docs/workflow-notes.md` for an overview of the main workflows (import sessions, custom cards, products grid, Shopify helpers).  That file is maintained alongside code changes so you can quickly get back up to speed in future sessions.
